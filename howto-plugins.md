In the RabbitMQ Management API, the Shovel Management plug-in adds endpoints for listing, creating, and deleting shovels. Usage and examples are in the [GitHub repository's documentation](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-shovel-management#usage).

## Delayed Message plug-in
{: #delayed-message-plug-in}

The [delayed message plug-in](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange){: .external}, `rabbitmq_delayed_message_exchange` is a third-party plug-in that adds delayed messaging and scheduled messaging to RabbitMQ. 

To use the plug-in, declare an exchange with the type `x-delayed-type`. To delay a message, publish it with the `x-delay` header with the number of milliseconds to delay the message. More detailed usage information is in the [plug-in's documentation](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange#usage){: .external}.

## STOMP plug-in
{: #stomp-plug-in}

The [RabbitMQ STOMP plug-in](https://www.rabbitmq.com/stomp.html){: .external}, `rabbitmq_stomp`, supports sending [STOMP-formatted](http://stomp.github.io/){: .external} messages through RabbitMQ. The plug-in enables a port to handle STOMP traffic on your deployment, and it is TLS/SSL secured. The connection information for STOMP clients is in the `stomp_ssl` section of your deployment's [connection strings](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-connection-strings#the-stomp_ssl-section).

## RabbitMQ Management plug-in
{: #rabbitmq-management-plug-in-info}

The RabbitMQ Management plug-in, `rabbitmq_management`, provides access to your deployment through a web browser, `rabbitmqadmin`, and through the RabbitMQ API. For more information, see [Connecting with the RabbitMQ Management plug-in](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-management-plug-in). 

## JMS plug-in
{: #jms-plug-in}

The RabbitMQ JMS Topic Exchange plug-in, `rabbitmq_jms_topic_exchange`, is enabled by default for {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} deployments. This plug-in adds server-side support for the [RabbitMQ JMS client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-client){: .external} and supports JMS topic routing plus selection based on JMS SQL selection rules.

The RabbitMQ JMS Client is required to communicate with the plug-in. Review the [JMS Client documentation page](https://www.rabbitmq.com/jms-client.html){: .external} that is provided by RabbitMQ for more detailed information on installation and configuration, along with examples.

More detailed information about the JMS plug-in can also be found in the RabbitMQ JMS Topic Exchange plug-in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-jms-topic-exchange){: .external}.
