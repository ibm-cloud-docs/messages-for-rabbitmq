# Connecting with the RabbitMQ Management Plugin

{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq_full}} deployments have the RabbitMQ management plugin enabled by default, which enables access to your RabbitMQ from a web browser or from a command line client. 

The management plugin connection information is in the "cli" section of your [connection strings](./howto-getting-connection-strings.html). The table contains a breakdown for reference.

Field Name|Index|Description
----------|-----|-----------
`Bin`||The recommended binary to create a connection; in this case it is `rabbitmqadmin`.
`Composed`||A formatted command to establish a connection to your deployment. The command combines the `Bin` executable, `Environment` variable settings, and uses `Arguments` as command line parameters.
`Environment`||A list of key/values you set as environment variables.
`Arguments`|0...|The information that is passed as arguments to the command shown in the Bin field.
`Certificate`|Base64|A self-signed certificate that is used to confirm that an application is connecting to the appropriate server. It is base64 encoded.
`Certificate`|Name|The allocated name for the self-signed certificate.
`Type`||The type of package that uses this connection information; in this case `cli`. 
{: caption="Table 1. `rabbitmqadmin`/`cli` connection information" caption-side="top"}

* `0...` indicates that there might be one or more of these entries in an array.

## Connecting with a browser

The web address for your RabbitMQ deployment is composed of the _host_ and _port_ parts of your connection strings. The are combined into a URL: `https://<host>:<port>`.

For example, `https://1a619c43-6425-4abb-8df0-0c7b1b3a3001.8f7bfd8f3faa4218aec56e069eb46187.databases.appdomain.cloud:31797`

Since {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} deployments are signed with a self-signed certificate, you will most likely get a security warning when you first try to open the page. You can verify the correct certificate by comparing it with the decoded certificate provided in your connection strings and add an exception to your browser.

You are next taken to a login page with a prompt to enter the username and password. After you have signed in, you can see an _Overview_ of your RabbitMQ. 

Documentation can be found on the [RabbitMQ Management Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) page.

## Installing `rabbitmqadmin`

The `rabbitmqadmin` binary is available directly from your deployment. The download and installation instructions are found on `/cli` page of the management plugin. For example,
`https://1a619c43-6425-4abb-8df0-0c7b1b3a3001.8f7bfd8f3faa4218aec56e069eb46187.databases.appdomain.cloud:31797/cli`

`rabbitmqadmin` is also available with a full, local installation of the RabbitMQ package. However, if the version of the package you download doesn't match the deployment's RabbitMQ version, it might not connect.

## Connecting with `rabbitmqadmin`

The example command lists all the exchanges in your RabbitMQ.

```
rabbitmqadmin --username=admin --password=$PASSWORD --ssl --ssl-ca-cert-file=0b22f14b-7ba2-11e8-b8e9-568642342d40 --host=1a619c43-6415-4abb-8df0-0c7b1b3a3001.8f7bfd8f3faa4218aec56e069eb46187.databases.appdomain.cloud --port=31797 list exchanges
```

* `rabbitmqadmin` : The command itself.
* `--username` and `--password` : Authentication for the user that you are using to connect.
* `--ssl` : ensures that the connection is TLS/SSL secured.
* `--ssl-ca-cert-file=` : Path to the local copy of your certificate.
* `--host=` : The parameter that specifies the endpoints where the `rabbitmqadmin` command connects.
* `--port=` : The parameter that specifies the port the RabbitMQ server is listening on. 
* `list exchanges` : A `rabbitmqadmin` command to list the database members of the RabbitMQ deployment. 

Documentation and other examples for `rabbitmqadmin` are on the RabbitMQ [Management Command Line Tool](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html) page.

## Using the self-signed certificate

1. Copy the certificate information from the Base64 field of the connection information. 
2. Decode the Base64 string into text and save it to a file. (You can use the Name that is provided or your own file name).
3. Provide the path to the `--ssl-ca-cert-file` parameter.

### CLI plug-in support for the self-signed certificate

You can display the decoded certificate for your deployment with the CLI plug-in with the command `ibmcloud cdb deployment-cacert "your-service-name"`. It decodes the base64 into text. Copy and save the command's output to a file and provide the file's path to the `--ssl-ca-cert-file` parameter.
