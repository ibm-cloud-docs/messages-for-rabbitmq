{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} Version 4.2 is Preferred
: There are important changes in this version to align with the [RabbitMQ v4.2 release series](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.2.0){: external}.

  - RabbitMQ v4.2 is available on {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} in [Preferred](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-versioning-policy&interface=ui#version-tags). Service changes applied on {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4.1 will continue on v4.2 and future versions. For more information, see the [version 4 realease notes](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-relnotes#messages-for-rabbitmq-10sep2025).
  - If you are using RabbitMQ v3.13 or RabbitMQ v4.1, you can upgrade to v4.2 directly using [backup and restore](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading&interface=ui) or by using [shovel](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-shovel&interface=ui).
  - Some highlights of v4.2 are as follows:
      - You are encouraged to switch to [Quorum Queues](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-migrating_classic_quorum&interface=ui) with this version upgrade, because Classic Queues do not guarantee high availability of the messages.
      - Khepri will be the default datastore for the newly created instances.
      - Quorum queues now have a default [redelivery limit](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/next/quorum-queues#poison-message-handling){: external} set to 20. Messages that are redelivered 20 times or more will be [dead-lettered](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/dlx) or dropped (removed).


{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4.1 End of Life on August 12 2026
: Action is required before August 12 2026 for RabbitMQ v4.1 deployments. After August 12 2026, active v4.1 instances will automatically be force upgraded to v4.2.
  - Deployments of IBM Cloud Messages for RabbitMQ v4.1 can be upgraded to v4.2.
  - Deployments of IBM Cloud Messages for RabbitMQ v3.13 can be upgraded to v4.2, skipping v4.1.
  - For more information, see [Upgrading to a new major version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading&interface=ui) and [Migrating from Classic Queues to Quorum Queues](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-migrating_classic_quorum&interface=ui).


Policy update: reverting to Standard Versioning
: {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} is reverting the versioning policy [announced in November 2025](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-relnotes&interface=ui#messages-for-rabbitmq-05november2025). Starting with version v4.x, the following policy applies:
   - A 6-month notification and upgrade window will be provided.
   - The latest vendor versions are offered; you should upgrade as soon as new versions are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
   - Deprecated versions will be automatically force upgraded after the EOL date.

     No SLA is provided for instances upgraded using this automatic method.

{: release-note}

{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version policy changes starting version v4.x
: To align with the open-source project owners of RabbitMQ, {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} (an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} managed service) is updating its version lifecycle policies starting with RabbitMQ v4.x.
  1. Two months advance notification of version deprecation will be provided for a major version.
  2. {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} will support only one version, the latest, outside of the few weeks period (minimum 2 weeks) during which you should upgrade from the version being deprecated to the new version.
  3. Instances that are using a deprecated version will be ‘automatically force upgraded’ to the next major version after the EOL date. However, no SLA will be provided for this upgrade method.

**Please note:**
We do not recommend that you wait until the end-of-life date for the following reasons:
   - We provide **no SLAs** for this type of forced upgrade.
   - You may experience some data loss.
   - Your application may experience downtime.
   - Your application may stop working if it has any incompatibilities with the new database version.
   - You cannot control the timing of when this upgrade will happen for your deployment.
   - There is no rollback process for this forced upgrade.

For more information on upcoming version EOL, see the [{{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} version policy page](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-versioning-policy).

**Note**: {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} backup includes only configuration. Data (messages) is not backed up.

**Customer impact**: Frequent major version upgrades are expected with a shorter 2-month timeline to upgrade. Automatic forced upgrade will occur on EOL date.

**Customer action needed**: You are expected to [perform major version upgrade](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading&interface=ui) using *backup & restore* or *Shovel* before EOL date to align with the updated policy and to be on a supported version of the service.

{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4.1 is Preferred
:  There are important changes in this version in alignment with the [RabbitMQ v4 release series](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1).

RabbitMQ v4.1 is available on {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} in [Preferred](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-versioning-policy&interface=ui#version-tags). Service changes applied on {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4.0 Preview will continue on v4.1 and future versions. For more information, see the [version 4 realease note](#messages-for-rabbitmq-18mar2025).

Customers on RabbitMQ v3.13 can upgrade to v4.1 using [backup and restore](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading&interface=ui) or by [shovel](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-shovel&interface=ui). Customers are encouraged to switch to [Quorum Queues](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-migrating_classic_quorum&interface=ui) with this version upgrade, as Classic Queues does not guarantee high-availability of the messages.

{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4 is available in Preview
: Validate your application on {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} version 4. There are important changes in this version in alignment with the [RabbitMQ v4 release](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/releases/tag/v4.0.1).

  1. Mirrored (HA) Classic Queues will be unsupported: Starting version 4, [Mirrored Classic Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/3.13/ha) will not be supported. When migrating from v3.13 to v4, remove the Classic Queue HA policy. Details can be found at [Migrating from Classic Queues to Quorum Queues](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-migrating_classic_quorum), and [Upgrading from v3.13 to v4](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading&interface=ui#upgrading-ui-v313-to-v4).

  2. Quorum Queues will be the default queue type: Until v3.13, Classic Queues were the default queue type selected when {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} instance was provisioned. Starting with v4, Quorum Queues will be the default queue type at the instance creation.

  3. Non-HA Classic Queue: You can still choose to use Classic Queues, however, it must be noted that messages cannot be highly-available due to the absence of Classic Queue HA policies. Using this configuration will be outside the scope of the support by the {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} service.

  4. Feature compatibility: While Quorum Queues are a better queue type when compared to Mirrored Classic Queues, they are not 100% compatible feature-wise with Mirrored Classic Queues. For more information, see the [feature matrix table](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/3.13/quorum-queues#feature-matrix) and [Migrate your RabbitMQ Mirrored Classic Queues to Quorum Queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/3.13/migrate-mcq-to-qq).

{{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq}} Version 3.12 [Preview](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-versioning-policy#version-tags){: external} Release
:  Version 3.12 is released as a Preview. Features in this release:
   - [Optimizations](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/05/rabbitmq-3.12-performance-improvements/){: external} for both quorum and classic queues: improved throughput, lower throughput variability, lower latency, lower memory footprint.
   -  More mature and efficient implementation of (nonmirrored) classic queues v2 (CQv2).
   - Classic queue lazy and non-lazy modes no longer apply: classic queues v2 always behave similarly to the lazy mode in earlier release series: moving data to disk aggressively and only keeping a subset of data in memory.
   - Significantly [reduced MQTT and Web MQTT memory footprint per connection](https://blog.rabbitmq.com/posts/2023/03/native-mqtt/){: external}.
   - [RabbitMQ Shovel](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-rabbitmq-shovel){: external} plug-in now requires to have `verify_none` configured.

RabbitMQ Version 3.11 Release
:  {{site.data.keyword.messages-for-rabbitmq_full}} version 3.11 is now available. With this release, messages that are delivered by a quorum queue and negatively acknowledged with a requeue are added to the back of the queue until the queue has redelivery limit set. With a redelivery limit, requeueing uses the original position of the message, if possible. With this update, if you get stuck or requeue deliveries at a high rate, you do not indefinitely grow the quorum queue Raft log, potentially driving the node out of disk space. If the original behavior is important to keep, ensure your applications' quorum queues have a redelivery limit set. This is a **potentially breaking change**. For more information, see [Upgrading to a new Major Version](/docs/messages-for-rabbitmq?topic=messages-for-rabbitmq-upgrading).

Unmirrored Classic Queues Handling Change
:  With the release of version 3.11, unmirrored classic queue handling is changed. If a node was to be shut down during maintenance, an unmirrored classic queue was automatically moved to another node. With version 3.11, this behavior is changed to match the documented RabbitMQ behavior. An unmirrored classic transient queue is deleted and an unmirrored classic durable queue is unavailable during that time. For more information, see RabbitMQ's [Classic Queue Mirroring](https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html#non-mirrored-queue-behavior-on-node-failure).{: external}

`idle_since` field now uses RFC 3339 format
